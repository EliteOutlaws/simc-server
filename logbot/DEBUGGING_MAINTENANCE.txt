Protocol 2014/06/08 by philoptik:

- Logbot is controlled by monit. Configuration file at /etc/monit/conf.d/irclogbot.conf

- There is a logbot user, which runs the logbot. ~ of logbot is /srv/logbot

- Logbot monit start command is: "su - logbot -c 'cd logbot; screen -d -m ./logbot.py'"

- One can attach to the running logbot screen by entering "sudo su - logbot -c 'screen -r'". At first, this will
fail because the display cannot be attached. Solved by calling "sudo chown 777 /dev/pts/<N>".

- Logbot irc logs go to: /srv/logbot/logbot/logs
