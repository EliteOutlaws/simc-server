      <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>Increasing class synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers have eroded the accuracy of traditional calculators that rely upon closed-form approximations to model very complex mechanics. The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.</p>

      <p>The primary purpose of this site is to host sample analysis generated by SimulationCraft. This provides players with easy access to simulation results at various gear points and patch levels.</p>
      
      <p>It is important that information flow in both directions. After examining the reports, players may detect <b>inconsistencies</b> with their experiences in-game. In addition, <b>inefficiences</b> (talents, glyphs, gear, gems, enchants) may be found in the supplied profiles. <b>Please</b> take the time to open an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/issues/list"><b>issue</b></a> or leave a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/Feedback"><b>comment</b></a>. We are continuously looking for new profiles, both at the normal and heroic levels.</p>

      <p>If you need help on running SimulationCraft, developing custom actions lists, or have other questions, please see our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/StartersGuide">extensive documentation</a>.
