  <h1 style="color: red;">Important Notice - Updated 12-30-14</h1>
  <p>
    We have implemented the new Armory API endpoints into Simcraft. In the previous release (603-20) we mentioned that end users would be required to get their own key.
	<p>However, we have decided to include a default API key as it is a bit unreasonable to expect everyone to get a key. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/BattleArmoryAPI">Details and Instructions on how to get your own API key are still located here.</a></p>
