  <p>
    There are currently issues with loading characters from armory. Generally, if you attempt to reload the character after a few seconds it will work.
	At this time we do not know how long it will be until it is functional again, but if any announcements are made by Blizzard, they will likely be
	located <a href="http://us.battle.net/en/forum/15051532/?page=1">on this forum.</a>
	
	We are currently preparing Simulationcraft so that it is able to handle the upcoming API transition for the armory, which will hopefully resolve most of these issues.

  If you want to import your in-game character, you can use the <a

  Addon</a> to generate a profile in-game, and copy paste it to a file or the
  GUI simulate window.
