  <p> This update will end GUI support for Windows XP, as we have swapped the engine for displaying websites, and Chromium does not support XP. The command line interface will continue to work on Windows XP SP3.</p>
  <p> This change will (eventually) lead to a better user experience. There will be some growing pains, but we will have them worked out as quickly as possible.</p>
