  <p> There is a known issue with the 64-bit Windows Download. When loaded on integrated videocards, such as Intel HD4000, it will load HTML pages extremely slowly for people on Windows 7.  It appears that the 32-bit version does not have this issue, so if this happens, simply swap to the 32-bit download until this can be resolved. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/issues/detail?id=2352">If you are having issues like this, please upload your dxdiag here.</a></p>
  <p> This update will end GUI support for Windows XP, as we have swapped the engine for displaying websites, and Chromium does not support XP. The command line interface will continue to work on Windows XP SP3.</p>
  <p> This change will (eventually) lead to a better user experience. There will be some growing pains, but we will have them worked out as quickly as possible.</p>
