  <h1 style="color: red;">Important Notice - Updated 12-23-14</h1>
  <p>
    We have implemented the new Armory API endpoints into Simcraft. However, they will not be activated by default, as they require an API Key, which can be 
	obtained by going to the <a href="https://dev.battle.net/">Battle.Net Dev Website.</a>
	<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/BattleArmoryAPI">Instructions on how to obtain API key and apply it to Simulationcraft.</a></p>
	<p>If you do not wish to register a key, Simulationcraft will continue to use the older methods to grab your armory still, but may fail from time to time.
	However, we do not know how long Blizzard will keep the older methods available, so you may eventually be required to get your own key.</p>
