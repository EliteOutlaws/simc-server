  <h1 style="color: red;">Important Notice - Updated 12-23-14</h1>
  <p>
    We have implemented the new Armory API endpoints into Simcraft. However, they will not be activated by default, as they require an API Key, which can be 
	obtained by going to the <a href="https://dev.battle.net/">Battle.Net Dev Website.</a>
	
	Registering a key is incredibly easy.
	1: Click Register, fill that form out, confirm email address
	2: Sign in, click "My Account" on the top right corner
	3: Add a key/Applications tab
	4: The <b>only required field</b> on the key registration is the name of the application, "Simulationcraft User"
	5: Register, it will take you back to "My API Keys"
	6: Copy/Paste the 32-character key into Simulationcraft under "Options" "Globals" "Advanced Settings"
	
	If you do not wish to register a key, Simulationcraft will continue to use the older methods to grab your armory still, but may fail from time to time.
	However, we do not know how long Blizzard will keep the older methods available, so you may eventually be required to get your own key.
