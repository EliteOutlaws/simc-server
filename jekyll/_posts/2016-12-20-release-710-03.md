## Release 710-03 notes
  * **Healers are not supported, and [currently have no developer working on them.](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc#how-can-i-contribute)**
  * Entirely too many notes to include everything -- [this will list all differences since 710-02] (https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/compare/release-710-02...release-710-03)
  * Hotfixes Current as of 2016-12-19
  * PTR 7.1.5 is supported, enable ptr mode to test
  * [Hunters and Death Knights are still lagging behind.](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc#how-can-i-contribute)
* #### New Features
  * Added simple verification of use_item actions
  * single_actor_batch - Speeds up multi-character raid simulations significantly -- Anywhere from 1.5-2.0x faster.
    * The speed increase is from simulating each character individually, then combining them at the very end.
    * Recommend to add fixed_time=1 to your simulation while using this option, especially on shadow priests with surrender to madness and any execute-heavy spec
    * **VERY BETA, MAY BREAK. Please report any breakages.**
* #### Updated/Fixed
  * copy= should now copy all artifacts
  * Improved modeling of many items
    * Ursoc's Rending Paw, Ring of Collapsing Futures, Luffa Wrappings, Eye of Command
  * Fixed crashes, as always
* #### Warrior
  * Added Into The Fray
  * Protection should be mostly finished
  * Berserker's Fury trinket no longer works at level 110
  * Added option to disable automatic heroic leap with heroic charge.
    * Ex: actions+=/heroic_charge,disable_heroic_leap=1,if=rage<30
