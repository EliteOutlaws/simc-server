## Release 710-01 notes
  * **Healers are not supported, and [currently have no developer working on them.](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc#how-can-i-contribute)**
  * Entirely too many notes to include everything -- [this will list all differences since 703-03] (https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/compare/release-703-03...release-710-01)
  * Hotfixes Current as of 2016-10-30
  * Note: 7.1 had massive changes to spells, splitting some spells into multiple ranks where the resource gain would be in the second rank of the spell, while the damage would be in the first.
    * If you notice something is not modeled properly, it may be due to this. [Please create a issue here] (https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues)
  * Hunters and Death Knights are still a work in progress, but should be usable.
