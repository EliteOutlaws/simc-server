## Release 603-21 notes
* #### General
  * Fix issue where GUI would not return to fullscreen when minimized
  * All settings/simulation tabs are now saved before simulations are started, which should prevent work lost from crashes
  * A default Battle.net Armory API Key has been added
    * Normal users will not need their own key anymore, just leave the apikey field blank
    * [More Information here](https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/BattleArmoryAPI)
  * threads
    * When threads is set to a negative number, it will use the maximum amount of logical cores, minus that amount
    * example with a 4-core, hyperthreaded cpu - 8 threads available: threads=-2 will use 6 total threads for the simulation
