## Release 603-10 notes
* Fix issue with GUI setting target level to 100 no matter what.
## Release 603-9 notes
* #### General
  * Disable MoP legendary procs at level 100
* #### Death Knight
  * Implement "baserunetype.death" expression.
    * Ex: "blood.death" will return the number of active blood runes that are currently death runes
    * Similarly, blood.death_frac will return the fractional rune amount for blood runes that are currently death runes
* #### Warlock
  * Reset Chaotic Infusion RPPM chance each iteration 
* #### Warrior
  * Overhaul Gladiator Detection, all protection warriors are assumed to be gladiator dps unless one of the following is true
    * 1: Check if Gladiator's Resolve is talented, if not, it's a tank
    * 2: Check if user has selected Tanking as their primary role, if so, it's a tank
    * 3: Check if "Mark of Blackrock" is on the player's weapon, if so, it's a tank -- Mark of Blackrock requires player to be below 50% hp to proc.
    * 4: Check trinkets to see if either trinket has stamina, if so, it's a tank
    * If anyone can think of more checks that can be made, post an issue and we'll try and add it. This will be tweaked over the next few weeks.
  * Devastate requires a shield
  * Add in checks for dual wielding or 2-hander/shield combo, since only Fury can do that
  * Reset Sudden Death RPPM chance each iteration
