## Release 612-01 notes
* #### New Features
  * Pawn addon output has been added again!
  * Experimental support for targets that are out of range, such as Iron Maidens - [read here for information](https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/source/detail?r=9bc77c9b66c9c7fb2f27d3551385dc2ca8675919)
    * Disabled by default, will be improved in future releases
    * Uses up to 3 range checks when necessary - If the spell can be cast, when the spell finishes casting, and then when AoE spells land
      * Ex: Whirlwind checks range when the spell lands, if one target is 15 yards away, it will not be hit
      * Ex: Fireball checks range to see if the target is in range before casting, and then will check again when the spell finishes casting, cancelling if the target went too far away
  * reforge_plot_iterations may now be set to a different value than iterations
  * Added sim option that will set normalized scaling factors base value to anything, rather than always being 1 - scaling_normalized=1
  * Implemented diminishing returns on speed ratings
  * Improve support for abilities that consume resources per tick/second
  * Add expression that will evaluate on-use buffs - use_buff.stat_name
    * Ex: bladestorm,if=use_buff.strength - Casts bladestorm when a trinket/item has been clicked/used that grants strength, and is currently up
