## Release 603-18 notes
* #### General
  * Fix NaN/Infinity issues with heal/absorb statistics
  * Fix wowhead gear links to include bonus ids and enchants
    * Gems are properly imported, but will not show up here as the GUI locks up when hovering over the tooltip. This will be (hopefully) be resolved when we swap from QT Webkit to QT WebEngine.
  * Change default Nitro Boosts behavior, will no longer be used unless there is movement. This will prevent the simulation from using boosts instead of a 2nd potion
* #### Death Knight
  * Model the unholy-specific reaping bug
    * If an unholy (Death) rune is used no a reaping ability, the unholy rune will not be reaped. Instead, the first regenerating non-death blood or  frost rune will be reaped
  * Might of the Frozen Wastes bonus to 2H autoattacks is only 30%, not 35%
  * Adjust hotfixes for Obliterate, Frost Strike and Defile
* #### Hunter
  * Don't cancel sim when /summon_pet is removed and lone wolf is talented
* #### Paladin
  * Update Ret Paladin Rotation
* #### Rogue
  * Re-introduce bugged behavior between Glyph of Vanish and Subterfurge talent
* #### Shaman
  * Tweak Lava Lash hotfix
* #### Warrior
  * Sudden Death Executes count toward anger management, even though they did not cost rage
  * Updated rotation for Scabbard
