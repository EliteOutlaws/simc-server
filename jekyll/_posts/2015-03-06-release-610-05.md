* #### General Simulation Changes
  * Updated spell/item data
  * Fixed compilation when using MINGW
  * Updated JQuery source url so that it is accessible from China
  * Fix position player option to persist after the first iteration
* #### GUI Changes
  * The GUI will reset all settings when loaded for the first time

  * Add option to automatically save html files when running simulations
    * Option #1: Set the html file name as the current date/time
    * Option #2: Every time a simulation is run, it will ask for the file name
  * Comboboxes will now save non-default settings when the program is closed/opened
    * Example: A fight length of 379 seconds will now persist, rather than being reset to 450
* #### Druid
  * Many in-game bugs were fixed, so they are now fixed in simc
  * Lunar Inspiration Hotfix
  * Bloodtalons is only consumed when an attack hits
* #### Hunter
  * Fix enhanced basic attack so that a wild hunt free attack still costs 25 focus.

  * T17 set bonuses do not scale with haste
* #### Monk
  * AP Multiplier from Brewmaster Mastery is multiplicative with raid buff
  * Healing elixirs cannot multistrike
* #### Paladin

  * Cascade can hit targets 3 times.
* #### Shaman

  * AP Multiplier from Warrior Mastery is multiplicative with raid buff
