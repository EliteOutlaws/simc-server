## Release 603-23 notes
* #### Windows Installation
  * The Windows 'zip' file now uses 7zip lzma compression wrapped in an autoextracting .exe file
    * This may flag security messages on your system, we can assure you that the file is safe
    * This was necessary to reduce the download size of the file, while maintaining compatibility
* #### GUI Changes
  * Previous release included a new browser engine, due to compatibility issues on Windows 7 we have decided to postpone using chromium.
    * We will revisit this when QT 5.5 is released
  * Whenever GUI options are reset, personal apikeys are no longer reset
  * Chinese Armorys will no longer open external browser
* #### General Simulation Changes
  * 2015-01-12 Hotfixes Applied to all specs
  * Multiple harmful spells may now be entered in precombat actions
    * The simulator will only allow spells that have travel time or cast time
    * Only 1 harmful spell will actually be cast, it will skip all other harmful precombat spells
    * This is useful when attempting to build rotations for different talents
  * Multiple add wave events will now act as expected
  * Always enable bonus armor scaling for Tanks, even when dps role is selected
* #### Death Knight
  * Updated action lists for all
* #### Druid
  * Eclipse energy will now show in the sample sequence table while in the negatives/solar
* #### Monk
  * Updated Windwalker action list
* #### Priest
  * Updated Shadow Priest action list
* #### Rogue
  * Updated action lists for all
  * Initial Honor Among Thieves proxy-proc occurs at 0.1 seconds into combat
* #### Warlock
  * SB: Haunt buff pandemics
  * Orc Racial benefits all pets
* #### Warrior
  * Fix issue where Tanks would sometimes not be attacked by fluffy pillow
