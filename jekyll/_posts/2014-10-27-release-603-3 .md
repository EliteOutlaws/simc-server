## Release notes
* #### General
  * 19085 Spell Data used
  * Shared CD for on-use items fixed
  * Updated Ask Mr Robot link formatting
  * Player Skill option has been improved, now allows for simulated "failure" of false positives
    * Example: action+=/wild_strike,if=rage>90 // A false positive would ignore the expression, and use wild strike if possible
    * Chance for false positives/negative failure ranges from 0%-25%, based on GUI options
    * With DoTs, false positives are not possible until half-dot duration. After this, the chance for failure increases linearly to to the maximum
* #### Druid
