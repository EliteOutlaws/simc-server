* #### Warlock
  * Updated action list for Demo
* #### Warrior
  * Colossus Smash multistrikes do not benefit from colossus smash armor penetration
  * Sweeping Strikes will now multistrike, but will no longer proc from multistrikes
    * Also doesn't benefit from versatility twice anymore
  * Fix Recklessness to grant the correct amount of crit damage
  * Fix T17-2P on AoE. Will now properly roll for a proc on each individual target hit with RB MH or OH
  * Added ravager_protection buff, to differentiate Fury/Arms and Protection
  * 'Heroic Charge' has been re-added
    * When used, tells the warrior to either run or leap out of melee range
	* If 'Charge' is in the action list, it will charge back to the target as soon as it reaches 8 yards
	* debuff.charge has been added to show the target that was last charged, since rage is not granted if the same target is charged again
    * Now used to alternate charging on multiple targets during execute range
  * Simulations that only have Fury/Arms warriors will now default to using fixed_time
    * This has been added due to the issue of fluffy pillow exploding <20%, which led to extremely low execute uptime compared to ingame
    * This lower execute uptime attributed to the devaluation of mastery for Arms, and inflated the value of furious strikes for Fury
	* setting warrior_fixed_health=0 will disable this
