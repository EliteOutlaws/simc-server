## Release 612-02 notes
* #### New Features
  * 19988 PTR Spelldata included - Invoke via ptr=1 or the gui options
  * All DPS class specific trinkets and set bonuses have been implemented
    * Demonology T18 4P is not implemented due to lack of information
    * Some set bonuses (Mostly pet-related) contain educated guesses that we have not been able to test yet, these will be updated as more information is available
    * Tanks/Healer bonuses are generally not implemented at this time
    * set_bonus=tier18_2pc=1 and set_bonus=tier18_4pc=1 will activate set bonuses, as well as the global sim options below
    * trinket1=blargh,id=0000000 - with the actual item id in place of the zeros will work for trinkets
  * Most mechanic changes are implemented for PTR
  * Sim Options - enable_2_set enable_4_set disable_2_set disable_4_set
    * Globally enable a specific set for all players in simulation
    * ex: enable_2_set=18 disable_4_set=17 - This will enable T18 2P and disable T17 4P on every character in sim
  * Pets have undergone sweeping changes with how they are initialized. This has resulted in significant memory savings during a simulation.
    * Example: Raid_T17M.simc with 8 threads was using 1,750~ MB of RAM. After these changes, the sim only uses 1350~ MB.
    * Root cause was that due to ( magic hands reasons that few care about) we initialized every pet ever created for a class, even if the class never used it.
    * Example: Every hunter created 10 thunderhawks (T15 2PC Bonus), every warlock created 25 fel imps even if they weren't demonology.
  * Italian has been added to localization for the gui
  * Raid Chart for Actions per Minute has been added	  
* #### Updated/Fixed features
  * Fixed crash with deterministic sims
  * fancy_target_distance_stuff (new name soonâ„¢)
    * optimized so that it doesn't abuse the cpu as much
    * Added support for ending a channelled cast if the target goes out of range
    * AoE Decay/Damage split AoEs are now properly modeled when one of the targets it out of range
    * Fixed a bunch of spells that incorrectly stated absurd numbers (100+) yards as their range
	* Expression added - active_enemies_within.x  - Where x is the number of yards, returns the number of targets within x yards
	  * Ex: active_ememies_within.10>1 - Will return true if there is more than 1 target within 10 yards of the simulated player
	* Expression Added - spell_targets.x - where x is the name of the ability, returns the number of targets within the range of that ability
	  * Ex: spell_targets.whirlwind>1 - Will return true if there is more than 1 target within the range of whirlwind, which will be 8 yards without a glyph
    * It is probably in a decent enough state for people to mess with it, but I would not recommend using it with Mages talented into Prismatic Crystal. 
* #### DeathKnight
  * Huge update to Unholy action list
* #### Druid
  * Updated action lists
  * Fixed Tooth and Claw to only apply to auto attacks
* #### Mage
  * Simulations will now end gracefully upon infinite loops in the action list
  * Various extremely rare crashes fixed, because prismatic crystal is just so much fun
  * Action list improvements
* #### Monk
  * Fixed huge bug introduced in 612-01 with weapon damage calculation
  * Breath of Fire is not affected by haste, and the dot will be applied to the proper target
  * Expel Harm healing calculations should now better reflect what is seen in game
* #### Priest
  * Updated action lists
* #### Rogue
  * Added 'poisoned_enemies' expression
* #### Warlock
  * Shards are now granted when a target dies while channelling drain soul
  * Chaos Wave will now trigger molten core
* #### Warrior
  * New option - non_dps_mechanics - default: 0
    * When set to 1, will enable mechanics that don't involve dps, such as bloodthirst healing, second wind, etc. 
    * It is turned on by default for tanks
  * Somewhere between 6.0 and now Blizzard changed Deep Wounds + Enhanced rend/Rend so that they add to Bloodbath.
  * Small improvements for Gladiator's action list
