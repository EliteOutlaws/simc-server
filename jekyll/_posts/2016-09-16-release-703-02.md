## Release 703-02 notes
  * **Healers are not supported, and [currently have no developer working on them.](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc#how-can-i-contribute)**
  * Entirely too many notes to include everything -- [this will list all differences since 703-01] (https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/compare/release-703-01...release-703-02) -- Will list every change since the last release
  * Hotfixes Current as of 2016-09-15
* #### New Features
  * Armory Imports are now functional
  * GUI fight length default is now 300 seconds
  * Implemented Items: Six-Feather Fan, Caged Horror, Eyasu's Mulligan, Marfisi's Giant Censer, Raging Furystone, Gnawed Thumb Ring, Tempered Egg of Sepertrix
  * Off-gcd abilities now benefit from action queueing
  * Added support for Blizzard's new cooldown category sharing
* #### Updated/Fixed
  * Many crashes 
  * Release now uses a non-beta version of QT so that Windows Defender doesn't flag it as a virus
  * artifact_override will also override relics on weapon
  * gcd.remains will now return 0 instead of negative numbers if the gcd is already ready
  * Most classes had some sort of action list update
    * Hunter + DK probably need some action list love
* #### Death Knight
  * Implement Duration penalty to apoalypse summons
    * Defaults to 5 seconds (for a total of 10 second of active time for ghouls). Controllable through "duration_penalty" option, i.e., actions+=/apocalypse,duration_penalty=3 would make the duration penalty only 3 seconds, for a total of 12 seconds of active time for ghouls.
* #### Demon Hunter
  * Death sweep may extend Metamorphosis
* #### Druid
  * Fix Stellar Flare damage
  * Fix amount of astral power gained by moonfire/sunfire
  * Full Moon always deals full damage to primary target
* #### Hunter
  * Fix crash for hati's beast cleave
  * Fix Fury of the Eagle to not use weapon damage
* #### Mage
  * Fix PI Crit interaction with non-fire effects
  * Non-cast LB should not consume resources
* #### Monk
  * Mastery is not factored into Tornado Kick
  * Fixed Chi Burst and Breath of Fire not AoEing
  * Force SotWL to have a damage variance on the player; not on SEF
* #### Priest
  * Shadow - T19 2P only affects Vampiric Touch now.
* #### Rogue
  * Added Gouge + Dirty Tricks
  * Disable saber slash chaining and adding CP consumption to logs

* #### Warlock
  * Initial soul shards hotfixed to 3
  * Fix Darkglare Eye Laser
  * Disable pandemic extension from Shadowflame
  * Make meteor strike summon infernals when talented with GoSup
* #### Warrior
  * **Protection is still a work in progress**
  * Arms is the main beneficiary of the off gcd queueing changes noted above
    * Default action list focused rage usage is too precise even for the best players with these queueing changes, this will be tweaked by the next release, likely with a 3-5% dps loss
  * Heavy Repercussions now adds 1.5 seconds instead of 0.15 to shield block
  * Ignore pain now expires when it hits 0 absorb
  * Legendary Pants increase radius of heroic leap
