## Release 623-01 notes
* #### New Features
  * All features from new patch are included.
  * **IMPORTANT** Armory imports will NOT include upgraded items, this is a problem with Blizzard's API. When/if Blizzard fixes this, they are supported in Simulationcraft
    * For now, add ,upgrade=1 or ,upgrade=2 to the end of the item text to do this
    * If you are not sure how to do this, [click here for a short how-to video.](http://downloads.simulationcraft.org/upgradegear.mp4) 
  * Also implements the +daemon% damage buffs. Use `target_rage=demon` to make Fluffy_Pillow a demon.
    * Note that `target_race` will make all enemies demons. There is no way currently to make singular enemies demon in a multi-enemy sim. The buff extension killing blow mechanism of the Str trinket is not implemenented.
* #### Updated/Fixed features
  * World of Warcraft 6.2.3 build 20726 data, remove obsolete hotfixes.
  * Allow canceling of plot/reforge simulations
  * Various fixes for spell query
  * Swapped to Wowdb tooltips, as they will not cause the GUI to lock up
  * Removed engineering on-use items from appearing in default APLs, so they will no longer interfere with potion use. Grounded Plasma Shield is also implemented.
  * Crash fixes
* #### Druid
  * Updated moonkin BIS, changed talents + rotation update. 
* #### Monk
  * Fixed Pool of Mists' interaction with RSK; Fixed AA interaction with Mistweavers; overhauled Mistweaver APL
  * Fixed a bug with Surging Mist; Renamed the Chi Sphere "gain" to Power Strikes; added Power Strikes to Mistweaver APL
  * Instant Surging GCD is affected by haste, despite not being in the list of effects for Focus and Harmony (supported by logs)
