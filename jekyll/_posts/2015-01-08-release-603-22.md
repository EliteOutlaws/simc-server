## Release 603-22 notes
* #### GUI Changes
  * ** Windows XP Support has ended for GUI due to the swap to Chromium 
    * Warning has been added for people who still use XP
	* Command Line Interface will continue to work for people using Win XP Service Pack 3
  * Windows GUI now uses a version of Chrome ('Chromium') for the web browser tabs
    * This is a large overhaul, there may/will be bugs. [Please report any missing features or bugs that you stumble on](https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/issues/list)
    * This is necessary as the previous browser ('Webkit') has been deprecated, and QT will no longer be actively updating it
    * OSX's implementation of Webkit has been superior to Windows, so it will not be transitioned until a later date
    * The user experience should be much smoother in the long-run, as this will result in fewer freezes while loading reports or websites
    * Known Issue: When clicking links that used to be loaded externally into your normal browser, the gui will flicker for a second
      * This is due to a lack of support for external linking for Chromium, so it was [hacked/kludged in.](https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/source/detail?r=31c2ffd8c0ca7eaf21dc70ac536f5b32c3a97fb4) QT will add proper support in the future. 
  * Localization has been added for Chinese and German
    * [Help us Localize!](https://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/Localization)
	* On first load, it will automatically select the system language, if available
    * Swapping can be done inside of the options tab, the program must be reloaded to enable another language
  * Warning added for people using Windows 7 without Service Pack 1, as not having SP1 is the leading cause of Simc not loading  
  * History Tab of GUI will now properly save armory link, rather than the api link
  * When a character is imported via battle.net, a progress bar will show, alerting the user that the import button has been clicked
* #### General Simulation Changes
  * Pre-pots are now done 2 seconds before combat, rather than 5
  * threads ( 603-21 )
    * When threads is set to a negative number, it will use the maximum amount of logical cores, minus that amount
    * example with a 4-core, hyperthreaded cpu - 8 threads available: threads=-2 will use 6 total threads for the simulation
    * **This option is now enabled for OSX** ( 603-22 )
* #### Death Knight
  * Implemented in-game behavior of blood boil disease spreading for Frost/Unholy
  * Correct Breath of Sindragosa to not cost more runic power with more targets
  * Hotfixes from January 5th
* #### Druid
  * Primal Tenacity does not scale with Versatility
  * Implement bug with Glyph of Savage Roar
  * Fix Balance of Power to extend dots 6 seconds rather than 6 milliseconds
  * Fixed issue where Feral was not considered melee for raid events
* #### Hunter
  * Fix bug where Beastmastery's Kill Shot was usable on targets below 35% instead of 20%
  * Implement PVP 2pc focus generator with freezing trap
* #### Mage
  * Prevent spell Multistrikes from proccing Arcane Missiles
* #### Monk
  * All Hotfixes as of January 8th
  * Massive overhauls. Way too many to mention
    * Code re-write for:
      * Spinning Crane Kick
      * Rushing Jade Wind
      * Fists of Fury
	  * This re-write fixed bugs with all 3 abilities, which will lead to damage result differences
    * Support has been added for Storm, Earth and Fire
    * Death Note added
* #### Paladin
  * Ret PVP 4-piece hotfix
* #### Priest
  * Fix Crash with Mastery procs and Disc Priests
* #### Rogue
  * All Hotfixes as of January 8th
  * Adjust Hemorrhage refresh to use normal refresh instead of clipping
  * Removed initial 5 combo points on start of combat for Sub
* #### Warrior
  * The Anger Management Bug was implemented after 603-21 was released, and 'fixed' before this release, so there is no change
