Jekyll is a tool to easily generate static html pages from a set of files.

layouts define the main page set up, composed of files from the _includes directory

Creating a new page is as easy as adding the header to include the default layout, and writing the contents
afterwards.


Blog System:
In the _posts folder, you can create new markdown (.md ) or textile (.textile) files for blog post
like entries.
The files need to have the format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP  , eg. 2014-03-09-release547-2.md
Post entries should have the layout: posts, for easy preview functionality.
They can be previewed eg. at http://www.simulationcraft.org/2014/03/09/release547-2.html

Release Posts:
- If the post contains the tag 'release', it will be included into the Download page.
